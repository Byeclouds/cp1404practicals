Regarding task estimation accuracy:
The accuracy of task estimates is a key project management metric. In past experience, I have seen improvements in the 
accuracy of estimates for tasks, primarily due to a deeper understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the 
project. Through the feedback mechanism, I learned how to more accurately estimate the time and resources required to 
complete tasks. Continuously summarizing experience, especially when dealing with new fields or technologies, also has 
a positive impact on improving the accuracy of estimates.

Learn about code review:
Through being reviewed and conducting code reviews, I learned the importance of friends’ mutual reviews and the key 
factors in code quality. While being reviewed, I learned more effective coding techniques and best practices from my 
classmates’ feedback. While conducting reviews, I developed an eye for reviewing code and better understood how to 
identify and improve potential issues. Code review not only improves code quality, but also promotes knowledge sharing 
and technology improvement.

In terms of overall management of practical tasks, if I were in charge of the subject, I would consider the following 
changes: First of all, I will strengthen the communication and collaboration mechanism with classmates to ensure smooth 
flow of information and clear project goals. Secondly, I will introduce a more flexible project management method to 
better adapt to changing needs. Additionally, I continue to learn to keep my skills updated and improve my overall 
performance level. Finally, I will drive innovative and experimental approaches to changing market and technology 
trends to ensure I stay ahead of the curve in a highly competitive environment.
