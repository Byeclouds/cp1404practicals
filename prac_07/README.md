# Practical 07 -Classes 2

This repository contains practical exercises and projects completed as part of the CP1404 course. Practices cover a 
range of activities consistent with CP1404 programming themes: clean code and effective software development practices.

## About the Author

I am [Zhenqi Ma], a student of James Cook University. I learn CP1404 in order to improve my programming skills and learn 
new techniques to create some useful applications.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout this course, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

1. **Naming**: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code more 
    understandable and maintainable.
2. **Comments and Documentation**: Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of code, 
   as well as using docstrings for functions and classes.
3. **Code Structure**: Use appropriate whitespace, indentation, and line breaks to make the code more readable, and 
   follow established language conventions and style guides.
